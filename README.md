# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Goal

The goal of this challenge was to create a Work Day Schedule, based on standard working hours, and allow the user to enter a task, save it, then have it stay on the page upon reloading. The current date and time will be displayed on top, while the rows for each timeblock will be color coded based on whether that block is in the past, present, or future.
